# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers of **EZ-Quiz** pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Showing respect and empathy toward others  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community  
- Being honest and kind in communication  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment of any kind  
- Publishing others’ private information (such as addresses or contact details) without explicit permission  

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, or other communication channels — and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at **seanyates76@gmail.com**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with simplifications for clarity and educational context.
