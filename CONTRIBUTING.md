## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Branch
Create a feature branch from main using a clear name:  
feature/improve-parser

### 2. Scope Clearly
Keep PRs small and focused:
- HTML-only: Add or adjust DOM hooks, avoid style or logic edits.  
- CSS-only: Adjust spacing, borders, or themes.  
- JS-only: Update logic or state handling via window.__EZQ__.  

If you‚Äôre touching multiple layers (HTML/CSS/JS), split it into multiple PRs unless trivial.

### 3. Follow the House Rules
- Vanilla JS only ‚Äî no frameworks or build tools.  
- Escape dynamic content with escapeHTML().  
- Use hidden and .is-open for visibility toggling.  
- Keep accessibility intact (focus outlines, tab navigation).  
- Never introduce console errors.  

### 4. Testing
Before committing:
1. Load the app locally or via Netlify Preview.  
2. Generate a quiz (topic: ‚Äútest‚Äù, 5 questions).  
3. Run through keyboard navigation only.  
4. Confirm #generatedMirror output works and no UI regressions occur.

### 5. Commit & PR
Use short, conventional messages:  
feat(ui): refine results summary layout  
fix(parser): handle empty question lines gracefully

Each PR should include:
- Summary of what changed and why.  
- Files touched and scope (HTML/CSS/JS).  
- Manual test steps.  
- Screenshot or Deploy Preview link if applicable.
