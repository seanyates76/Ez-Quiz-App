Highlights
- Clean default face: inline Topic, Length, Difficulty with responsive layout.
- Options hub: new drop-down with Timer, Theme, Question Types, and Save default.

  - Settings: “Always show advanced options” and “Reset support prompts”; Beta indicator at the bottom.

Notes
- Banner cadence does not show again once clicked on that device (can be reset in Settings).
- Question Types currently constrain generation; they do not filter manually pasted lines.

EZ Quiz Web v1.2.0-beta.4
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-11

Fixes & improvements
- Retake behavior: Main “Retake” always restarts the full quiz, regardless of whether “Missed” or “All” is selected in Results.
- Missed-only option: “Take missed quiz” (under the Retake caret) continues to run only the missed questions from the last attempt.
- Original set preserved: The original question set is stored when a quiz is parsed; full retakes restore from this source even after taking a missed-only run.
- Footer link: The version label is now clickable and links to the full CHANGELOG for quick tester review.
- Offline update: Service worker cache bumped to v58 to pick up the latest JS changes offline.

Tester tips
- To retake the full quiz, click “Retake”. To retake only missed questions, use the caret next to Retake and choose “Take missed quiz”.
- If you previously ran “missed-only”, “Retake” will still restore and run the complete original set.

EZ Quiz Web v1.5.0-beta.9
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-26

Highlights
- Resilient AI calls: client now cycles through `/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz`, `/api/generate`, and the Netlify hosts (`https://ez-quiz.netlify.app`, `https://eq-quiz.netlify.app`) so Start/Generate survive missing rewrites or external proxies.
- Cache bust: Asset query strings bumped to v1.5.14 with service worker cache v123 to guarantee the new fallback ships instantly.
- Security: CSP `connect-src` now whitelists the Netlify hosts (including `https://ez-quiz.netlify.app`) so browser policies allow the fallback calls.
- Gemini update: default backend model is now `gemini-2.0-flash`; override `GEMINI_MODEL` only if you have access to a different version.
- Reminder: All UI polish from beta.7 (softened surfaces, roomy toolbar, consistent spacing) remains in place.

Notes
- Still seeing the old build? Refresh with `?clear=1` or use Settings → Reset App to clear cached assets/service workers.

EZ Quiz Web v1.5.0-beta.8
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-26

Highlights
- Hotfix: Start/Generate now target `/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz` first, sidestepping missing `/api/generate` rewrites in production.
- Cache bust: Asset query strings bumped to v1.5.13 and service worker cache advanced to v122 so the fix reaches every client instantly.
- Reminder: All UI polish from beta.7 (softened surfaces, roomy toolbar, consistent spacing) remains in place.

Notes
- If the app still feels stale, refresh with `?clear=1` or use Settings → Reset App to clear caches/service workers.

EZ Quiz Web v1.5.0-beta.7
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-25

Highlights
- Softer UI tokens: inputs, cards, and buttons now use subtle 1px borders with a calm blue-violet focus halo for accessible contrast without the neon glow.
- Generator breathing space: the toolbar switches to a roomy two-column layout on 430–720px screens, making wide phones like the Pixel 9 Pro XL feel less cramped.
- Consistent spacing: section labels, modal groups, and results chips share the same relaxed gaps and radius tokens for a tidier rhythm across the app.
- Cache bust: CSS/JS query strings bumped to v1.5.12 with service worker cache v121 so the polish ships immediately.

Notes
- If highlights still look heavy, refresh or use Settings → Reset App to clear older assets.

EZ Quiz Web v1.5.0-beta.6
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-24

Highlights
- Generator polish: browser autofill now keeps the Topic field styled with our dark fill, smoothed corners, and consistent focus border.
- Layout: footer reserve is handled with an `::after` spacer so the background stays on-brand even when FAB space is reserved.
- Interactive Editor: keyboard shortcut listener now ignores events without a `key` value, preventing console errors during load.
- Cache bust: CSS/JS query strings bumped to v1.5.11 with service worker cache v120 to ensure the fixes ship immediately.

Notes
- If you still see the pale autofill box or footer bar, hard refresh or use Settings → Reset App to clear older caches.

EZ Quiz Web v1.5.0-beta.5
==========================

Release date: 2025-09-17

Highlights
- Generator polish: inline steppers built into the Length field, a custom difficulty slider with aligned ticks, and rounded toolbar corners.
- Interactive Editor default: visual editor loads first with an Interactive/Manual pill toggle; question type buttons and dropdowns now spell out the full names.
- Quiz Editor layout: question type checkboxes shed chip styling, Debug/Mirror toggle sits to the right inside its pill, manual textarea stays hidden while IE mode is active.
- Options vs Settings: theme choices live strictly in the Settings modal, Options focuses on timer/types/count defaults, and the Quiz Behavior section moved out.
- Prompt guidance: AI prompt now clarifies the Very Easy → Expert scale for providers.
- Cache bust: CSS/JS query strings bumped to v1.5.10 so the refreshed UI ships immediately to clients.

Notes
- Manual editor content still syncs with the Interactive Editor when you switch modes.
- Use Settings → Reset App or the `?clear=1` URL param if assets ever feel stale.
