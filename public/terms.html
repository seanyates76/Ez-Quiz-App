    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p style="color:var(--muted)">Effective: 04 September 2025</p>

    <h2>1) Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using EZ Quiz (the “App”), you agree to these Terms of Use and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2) Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The App provides a browser‑based quiz experience that can operate offline. Optional AI generation may be available via third‑party providers through serverless functions.</p>

    <h2>3) License and Use</h2>
    <p>Subject to these Terms, you are granted a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to access and use the App for personal or educational purposes. You may not reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute the App except as permitted by applicable law or an open‑source license in the project repository.</p>

    <h2>4) Your Content</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for the text you input or upload. Do not submit unlawful, harmful, or infringing content. If you enable AI generation, your prompts may be sent to third‑party AI APIs; you are responsible for ensuring your prompts comply with those providers’ terms.</p>

    <h2>5) Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>AI providers (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI) and external donation platforms are third‑party services. Their terms and privacy policies apply to your use of those services. We do not control and are not responsible for them.</p>

    <h2>6) Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>We may change, suspend, or discontinue the App or any feature at any time. We may update these Terms from time to time; the Effective date will be updated when changes are made.</p>

    <h2>7) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non‑infringement. Quiz content generated by AI may be inaccurate or incomplete; verify critical information independently.</p>

    <h2>8) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the App or third‑party services.</p>

    <h2>9) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the App’s authors and contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10) Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in your jurisdiction unless otherwise required by local consumer protection law.</p>
