    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p style="color:var(--muted)">Effective: 17 September 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>EZ Quiz is a lightweight, installable web app that runs primarily on-device. We designed it to minimize the collection and processing of personal data. This policy explains what the app does locally, what limited serverless calls may occur, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>What We Don’t Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No account creation</li>
      <li>No analytics, tracking pixels, or ad networks</li>
      <li>No storage of your quiz content on our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Processed Locally (On Your Device)</h2>
    <p>The app may store small settings in your browser’s storage to improve your experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Theme and UI preferences</strong> (e.g., dark/light mode, timer settings)</li>
      <li><strong>Progress state</strong> (in-memory while the app is open)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can clear these at any time using the in‑app “Reset App” action or your browser’s site data controls.</p>
    <p><em>Cookie note:</em> A single, optional cookie may be used to remember display preferences (e.g., “Always show advanced options”). It stores a simple true/false value and expires after roughly one year.</p>

    <h2>Service Worker and Offline Use</h2>
    <p>EZ Quiz uses a service worker to cache the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS/icons) for offline access. Cached assets remain on your device until you clear site data or the app refreshes its cache during updates.</p>

    <h2>Optional AI Generation</h2>
    <p>If you click “Generate,” the app may call a serverless function that in turn calls a third‑party AI API (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI) to generate quiz lines from your provided topic and length. We forward only what’s necessary to perform that request. Responses are returned to your browser and are not persisted by us.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Third‑party processors:</strong> Google (Gemini) and/or OpenAI, depending on configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Content transmitted:</strong> your chosen topic and generation parameters. We do not include your prior quiz answers or local settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Retention by providers:</strong> subject to each provider’s policies. Review their privacy documentation if you use AI generation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to send feedback using the in‑app panel, we collect only what you submit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Message</strong> (required) and <strong>Email</strong> (optional) that you type into the form.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic rate‑limit data</strong> (IP address), used transiently to prevent spam/abuse. This is stored in memory for a short window and not persisted by us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your feedback is relayed via email to the maintainer’s inbox. We do not create a database of submissions, but the email copy may be retained in the maintainer’s mailbox. Do not include sensitive personal information in feedback.</p>

    <h2>Payments and External Links</h2>
    <p>The “☕ Support” link navigates to an external donations page (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee). Interactions there are governed by that site’s terms and privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>EZ Quiz is a general‑audience app. It does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information via a third‑party form or service linked from the app, contact us so we can assist.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We follow reasonable practices for a static web app and serverless functions, including HTTPS, scoped API keys, and least‑privilege configuration. Because the app runs in your browser, the security of your device and browser also matters.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app entirely offline with manual input (no AI calls)</li>
      <li>Clear data via “Reset App” or by clearing your browser’s site storage</li>
      <li>Decline to use external links or AI features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy as the app evolves (for example, if we add providers or settings). We will revise the “Effective” date and publish the latest version here.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions or concerns? Reach out via the project repository or the support link in the app.</p>
