Changelog
=========

2025-10-22 — v3.3 (hotfix) / 1.5.18-hotfix
- Reset
  - Performs a cache-busting navigation to avoid BFCache/stale state after clearing SW + caches.
  - Cancels any pending beta soft reload and disables the Reset button after confirm to prevent double-trigger.
- Beta gating
  - Applies `body[data-beta]` at first paint from cookie to prevent flicker/mismatch in the Topic input + paperclip.
- Maintenance
  - Asset query tokens bumped to v1.5.18 and service worker cache advanced to v126 for consistent first-load behavior.

2025-10-22 — 1.5.0-beta.12
- UI
  - Explain (beta) shows a localized toast near the result item; removed the inline ribbon block.
  - Topic input + paperclip act as a single control: one soft focus border, no double outlines, and no redundant hover/autofill highlights.
- Dev/Test
  - Stabilized DOM tests: added `jest-environment-jsdom`, hardened HTML parsing in `tests/utils.js` to avoid parse5 ESM paths, and used Node Blob for header‑byte tests.
- Beta
  - Media import remains a stub when not deployed; UI shows friendly hints on 403/404/501.

2025-10-09 — Dev smoke test hardening
- Added dev smoke checks run via `npm run smoke` (uses ../ezq-dev-tools/tests/smoke.mjs)

- DOM: ensure app root renders; question block visible; >=2 options
- Keyboard: Tab reaches an option (focus visible warning if outline hidden)
- Data: basic quiz JSON schema validation; no duplicate stems in a run

- Selectors used: [data-test="app-root"], [data-test="start"], [data-test="question-block"], [data-test="question"], [data-test="option"]

2025-09-30 — 3.3
- Graduated the beta line to production, keeping the resilient AI fallback rotation so Generate/Start survive missing rewrites or proxy issues.
- Adopted the softened UI tokens, responsive toolbar grid, and balanced spacing from the recent betas as the default production experience.
- Finalized Quiz Editor parity: interactive/manual modes, mirror controls, and defaults stay aligned for everyday authoring.
- Maintained asset cache busting (query strings v1.5.17, service worker cache v125) to deliver the release instantly across clients.

2025-09-26 — 1.5.0-beta.9
- Resilience: AI calls now cycle through `/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz`, `/api/generate`, and Netlify hosts (`https://ez-quiz.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz`, `https://eq-quiz.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz`), covering missing rewrites or third-party proxies.
- Maintenance: asset query strings bumped to v1.5.17 and service worker cache advanced to v125 to flush cached modules (api/generator/main/editor).
- Security: CSP `connect-src` now includes the Netlify hosts (including `https://ez-quiz.netlify.app`) so the fallback calls aren’t blocked client-side.
- Gemini: default model bumped to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025`; override `GEMINI_MODEL` only if your account supports a different version.

2025-09-26 — 1.5.0-beta.8
- Hotfix: client now calls `/.netlify/functions/generate-quiz` before `/api/generate`, so Start/Generate continue to work even if redirects are missing.
- Maintenance: asset query strings bumped to v1.5.13 and service worker cache advanced to v122 to force-deliver the new module order.

2025-09-25 — 1.5.0-beta.7
- Generator toolbar now opens into a generous two-column layout on 430–720px screens so wide phones have comfortable spacing.
- Inputs, cards, and status chips share softened 1px borders with a muted focus halo for accessible, non-glowy highlights.
- Consistent label spacing and refreshed radius tokens across modals/results keep sections from feeling cramped.
- Maintenance: cache-buster query strings bumped to v1.5.12 and the service worker cache advanced to v121 for fast rollout.

2025-09-24 — 1.5.0-beta.6
- Generator: topic autofill now preserves the dark-theme fill and rounded corners while keeping the new footer spacer tinted to match the canvas.
- Quiz Editor: global key listener guards missing `event.key` values to avoid console errors when the page loads in unusual contexts.
- Maintenance: cache-buster query strings bumped to v1.5.11 and the service worker cache advanced to v120 so clients pick up these fixes.

2025-09-19 — 1.5.0-beta.5
- Generator UI overhaul: inline stepper controls, rebuilt difficulty slider with aligned ticks, rounded toolbar.

- PWA: Service worker cache bumped to v58 to ensure updated JS assets are picked up offline.

2025-09-08 — 1.2.0-beta.3
