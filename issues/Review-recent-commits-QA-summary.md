## Checklist results
| Layer | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML | ✅ Pass | Cache-buster refresh kept IDs/hooks intact. Help/Settings/Results anchors unchanged. |
| CSS | ✅ Pass | No new CSS in this window; existing tokens unaffected. |
| JS | ⚠️ Fail (Addressed) | PR #67 logic routes through existing modules; drag/drop helper disposes cleanly; beta redirects (`public/js/main.js`) work. However commit `18abc85` cleared the Settings-modal redirect hook, so enabling Beta no longer navigates to `/beta`. Fix provided in this PR by restoring the pending redirect handler (`public/js/modals.js`). |
| Netlify | ✅ Pass | `netlify/edge-functions/beta.ts` now uses `context.next()`; headers preserved. |

## Testing / Verification
- ✅ `npm test --silent`
- Manual Deploy Preview: not run (changes validated via static review; bug reproduced analytically).

## Outcome / Next steps
- Opened fix PR: restores Settings close redirect handling so Beta enablement navigates to `/beta` again.
